What is it?
------
Just a simple android phone calculator.
(Only Android!)


Technologies that are used to build the project
------
[React Native](https://reactnative.dev/)

Installation
------
If you need to debug and use, you need to install JDK, Android Studio and Node.js. Please follow the official documentation of [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup).

Clone this repo after all software installation is complete
```
git clone UOA-CS732-SE750-Students-2023/cs732-se75-assignment-dxh000130.git
cd ./cs732-se75-assignment-dxh000130
```
Install the module using npm
```
npm install
```
Run an Android emulator or use an Android phone.
Note: You need to enable developer mode and turn on usb debugging.
```
npx react-native run-android
```
Enjoy it!

OR You just want to experience this app, you can download the packaged apk file in the Release list on the right, and install it on an Android phone or an Android virtual machine


Future Plan
------

In the current version, the UI may appear garbled on some models. In the future, if possible, I will improve the UI first to ensure that the App can adapt to all Android devices.
Then study how to transfer it to the IOS device. (First I need a Mac os)
